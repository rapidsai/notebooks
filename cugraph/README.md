![GraphAnalyticsFigure](img/GraphAnalyticsFigure.jpg)

This repository contains a collection of Juyper Notebooks that outline how to run various cuGraph analytics.   The notebooks do not address a complete data science problem.  The notebooks are simply examples of how to run the graph analytics.  Manipulation of the data before or after the graph analytic is not covered here.   Extended, more problem focused, notebooks are being created and available https://github.com/rapidsai/notebooks-extended



## Notebook Types

Example code is broken into two subfolders

- SG - for Single GPU example
- MG - for Multi-GPU examples using DASK



## Notebooks

SG

- BFS Example 
- Louvain Example





## Requirements

Running the example in these notebooks requires:

* The latest version of RAPIDS with cuGraph.
  * Download via Docker, Conda, or PIP  
* cuGraph is dependent on the latest version of cuDF.  Please install all components of RAPIDS 
* Python 3.6+
* A system with an NVIDIA GPU:  Pascal architecture or better
