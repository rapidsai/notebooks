    "## Introduction\n",
    "Pagerank is measure of the relative importance, also called centrality, of a vertex based on the relative importance of it's neighbors.  PageRank was developed by Google and is (was) used to rank it's search results. PageRank uses the connectivity information of a graph to rank the importance of each vertex. \n",
    "\n",
    "See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) for more details on the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the Pagerank scores for a graph in cuGraph we use:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**cugraph.pagerank(G,alpha=0.85, max_iter=100, tol=1.0e-5)**\n",
    "* __G__: cugraph.Graph object\n",
    "* __alpha__: float, The damping factor represents the probability to follow an outgoing edge. default is 0.85\n",
    "* __max_iter__: int, The maximum number of iterations before an answer is returned. This can be used to limit the execution time and do an early exit before the solver reaches the convergence tolerance. If this value is lower or equal to 0 cuGraph will use the default value, which is 100\n",
    "* __tol__: float, Set the tolerance the approximation, this parameter should be a small magnitude value. The lower the tolerance the better the approximation. If this value is 0.0f, cuGraph will use the default value which is 0.00001. Setting too small a tolerance can lead to non-convergence due to numerical roundoff. Usually values between 0.01 and 0.00001 are acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns:\n",
    "* __df__: a cudf.DataFrame object with two columns:\n",
    "    * df['vertex']: The vertex identifier for the vertex\n",
    "    * df['pagerank']: The pagerank score for the vertex\n",
    "    \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "## cuGraph 0.7 Notice \n",
    "cuGraph version 0.7 has some limitations:\n",
    "* Only Int32 Vertex ID are supported\n",
    "* Only float (FP32) edge data is supported\n",
    "* Vertex numbering is assumed to start at zero\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations are being addressed and will be fixed future versions.  \n",
    "These example notebooks will illustrate how to manipulate the data so that it comforms to the current limitations    "
