    "# Dimensionality Reduction using GPU Accelerated PCA in RAPIDS\n",
    "#### Ivana Jovicic\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "While the world’s data doubles each year, CPU computing has hit a brick wall with the end of Moore’s law. For the same reasons, scientific computing and deep learning has turned to NVIDIA GPU acceleration, data analytics and machine learning where GPU acceleration is ideal. \n",
    "\n",
    "NVIDIA created RAPIDS – an open-source data analytics and machine learning acceleration platform that leverages GPUs to accelerate computations. RAPIDS is based on Python, has pandas-like and Scikit-Learn-like interfaces, is built on Apache Arrow in-memory data format, and can scale from 1 to multi-GPU to multi-nodes. RAPIDS integrates easily into the world’s most popular data science Python-based workflows. RAPIDS accelerates data science end-to-end – from data prep, to machine learning, to deep learning. And through Arrow, Spark users can easily move data into the RAPIDS platform for acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will also show how to use PCA - a popular dimensionality reduction algorithm - and how to use the GPU accelerated implementation of this algorithm in RAPIDS.\n",

    "\n",
    "Large number of features in the dataset is one of the factors that affect both the training time as well as accuracy of machine learning models. You have different **options to deal with huge number of features in a dataset**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try to train the models on original number of features, which take days or weeks if the number of features is too high.\n",
    "2. Reduce the number of variables by merging correlated variables.\n",
    "3. Extract the most important features from the dataset that are responsible for maximum variance in the output. Different statistical techniques are used for this purpose e.g. linear discriminant analysis, factor analysis, and principal component analysis.\n",

    "Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a statistical technique to **convert high dimensional data to low dimensional data** by selecting the most important features that capture maximum information about the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The features are selected on the basis of variance that they cause in the output. The feature that causes highest variance is the *first principal component*. The feature that is responsible for second highest variance is considered the *second principal component*, and so on. It is important to mention that principal components do not have any correlation with each other.\n",
