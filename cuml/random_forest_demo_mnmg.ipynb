    "# Random Forests Multi-node, Multi-GPU demo\n",
    "\n",
    "The experimental cuML Multi-node, Multi-GPU (MNMG) implementation of Random Forests leverages Dask to do embarrassingly-parallel model fitting. For a random forest with N trees being fit by W workers, each worker wil build N / W trees. During inference, predictions from all N trees will be combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The caller is responsible for partitioning the data efficiently via Dask. To build an accurate model, it's important to ensure that each worker has a representative chunk of the data. This can come by distributing the data evenly after ensuring that it is well shuffled. Or, given sufficient memory capacity, the caller can replicate the data to all workers. This approach will most closely simulate the single-GPU building approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** cuML 0.9 contains the first, experimental preview release of the MNMG Random Forest model. The API is subject to change in future releases, and some known limitations remain:\n",
    " * Each worker must have at least one data partition or fitting will throw an error\n",
    " * The fit method only works with cuDF dataframe inputs. Future versions will support more flexible input types.\n",
    " * Prediction only accepts numpy arrays as an input and performance may be suboptimal. Prediction requires scattering data to all workers, which can lead to inefficiencies that will be addressed in future versions."
