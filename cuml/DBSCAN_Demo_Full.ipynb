Since these data often don't have labels, clustering is often described as an unsupervised learning technique. While there are many different algorithms that partition data into unique clusters, we will show in this notebook how in certain cases the DBSCAN algorithm can do a better job of clustering than traditional algorithms such as K Means or Agglomerative Clustering. \n",

It then takes those two data points and identifies a third data point that is \"closest\" to those two data points.

    "## Clustering using DBSCAN\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike K Means or Agglomerative Clustering, DBSCAN is a density-based approach to spatial clustering. It views clusters as areas of high density separated by areas of low density. This approach has several advantages; whereas K Means focuses on finding centroids and assoicating data points with that centroid in a spherical manner, the DBSCAN algorithm can identify clusters of any convex shape. Additionally, DBSCAN is robust to areas of low density. In the above visualization, we see that Agglomerative Clustering ignores the low density space space between the interleaving circles and instead focuses on finding a clustering hierarchy that minimizes the Euclidean distance. While minimizing Euclidean distance is important for some clustering problems, it is visually apparent to a human that following the density trail of points results in the ideal clustering. \n",

However, the transactional overhead of moving data back and forth from the CPU to the GPU can quickly become negligible due to the performance speedup from computing on a GPU instead of a CPU."
