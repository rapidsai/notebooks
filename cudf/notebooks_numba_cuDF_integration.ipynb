    "In my previous tutorial, I showed how to use `apply_rows` and `apply_chunks` methods in cuDF to implement customized data transformations. Under the hood, they are all using [Numba library](https://numba.pydata.org/) to compile the normal python code into GPU kernels. Numba is an excellent python library that accelerates the numerical computations. Most importantly, Numba has direct CUDA programming support. For detailed information, please check out this [Numba CUDA document](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/cuda/index.html). As we know, the underlying data structure of cuDF is a GPU version of Apache Arrow. We can directly pass the GPU array around without the copying operation. Once we have the nice Numba library and standard GPU array, the sky is the limit. In this tutorial, I will show how to use Numba CUDA to accelerate cuDF data transformation and how to step by step accelerate it using CUDA programming tricks. \n",

    "cuDF is a powerful tool for data scientists to use. It provides the high-level API that covers most of the use cases. However, it also exposes its low-level components. Those components including gpu_array and Numba integration make the cuDF library to be very flexible to process data in a customized way. "
