    "# Introduction to Dask: Hello World!\n",
    "#### By Paul Hendricks\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "While the world’s data doubles each year, CPU computing has hit a brick wall with the end of Moore’s law. For the same reasons, scientific computing and deep learning has turned to NVIDIA GPU acceleration, data analytics and machine learning where GPU acceleration is ideal. \n",
    "\n",
    "NVIDIA created RAPIDS – an open-source data analytics and machine learning acceleration platform that leverages GPUs to accelerate computations. RAPIDS is based on Python, has pandas-like and Scikit-Learn-like interfaces, is built on Apache Arrow in-memory data format, and can scale from 1 to multi-GPU to multi-nodes. RAPIDS integrates easily into the world’s most popular data science Python-based workflows. RAPIDS accelerates data science end-to-end – from data prep, to machine learning, to deep learning. And through Arrow, Spark users can easily move data into the RAPIDS platform for acceleration.\n",

    "\n",
    "Dask is a library the allows for parallelized computing. Written in Python, it allows one to schedule tasks and do so dynamically as well handle large data structures - similar to those found in NumPy and Pandas. In the subsequent tutorials, we'll show how to use Dask with Pandas and cuDF and how we can use both to accelerate common ETL tasks as well as build ML models like XGBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about Dask, check out the documentation here: http://docs.dask.org/en/latest/\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask operates using a concept of a \"Client\" and \"workers\". The client tells the workers what tasks to perform and when to perform. Typically, we set the number of works to be equal to the number of computing resources we have available to us. For example, wer might set `n_workers = 8` if we have 8 CPU cores on our machine that can each operate in parallel. This allows us to take advantage of all of our computing resources and enjoy the most benefits from parallelization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask is a first class citizen in the world of General Purpose GPU computing and the RAPIDS ecosystem makes it very easy to use Dask with cuDF and XGBoost. As we see below, we can inititate a Cluster and Client using only few lines of code."
